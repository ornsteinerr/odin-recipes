    <h2> Ingredients </h2>

    <ul>
        <li> cup vegetable oil </li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
        <li> 1 large green bell pepper, chopped</li>
        <li>2 celery stalks, chopped</li>
        <li>1 pound andouille or smoked sausage, sliced 1/4 inch thick</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Creole seasoning to taste</li>
        <li>6 cups chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>1 rotisserie chicken, boned and shredded</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2> 
    <ol>
        <li>
            Heat the oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat. When hot, whisk in flour. Continue whisking until the roux has cooked to the color of chocolate milk, 8 to 10 minutes. Be careful not to burn the roux. If you see black specks in the mixture, start over.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir onion, bell pepper, celery, and sausage into the roux; cook 5 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook another 5 minutes. Season with salt, pepper, and Creole seasoning; blend thoroughly. Pour in the chicken broth and add the bay leaf. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer, uncovered, for 1 hour, stirring occasionally. Stir in the chicken, and simmer 1 hour more. Skim off any foam that floats to the top during the last hour.
